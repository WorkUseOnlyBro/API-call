# Start from official Python image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements first (for better caching)
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of your application
COPY . .

# Expose port if your app is a web service (adjust as needed)
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run your app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Key points:**
- We copy `requirements.txt` separately before copying everything else - this uses Docker's layer caching so dependencies don't reinstall every time you change code
- `--no-cache-dir` keeps the image smaller
- Adjust the `CMD` to however you run your app

## 3. Create a .dockerignore file

This prevents unnecessary files from being copied into your image:
```
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
.env
.git
.gitignore
.vscode
*.md
